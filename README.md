# GPA-Website
Daniel and I plan to make a GPA calculator in order for students to calculate their semester GPA. We plan to implement this on a website which we will utilize Ruby on Rails. In order for the user to access the website they must first make an account by entering their email and making a password to attain access to the website, and this will be done using Ruby authentication. Furthermore, we will make an algorithm utilizing Ruby in order to calculate the GPA and then display it to the user. Shawn will handle the algorithm portion of the project and Daniel will handle the website portion, and we will split the work with Ruby authentication.
